## Dependencies
- [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/) (>= 11.0)/GCC (>= 10.0)/MSVC (>= 14.20)
- [cmake](https://cmake.org) (>= 3.6)
- [boost](https://boost.org) (>= 1.76)

All dependencies managed by `nix`.

So first install nix using the following command:

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf -L https://install.determinate.systems/nix | sh -s -- install
```

then allow `nix-command` and `flakes` experimental features by adding line

```bash
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
```

in nix configuration file (`/etc/nix/nix.conf`).

## Build & test
To activate Nix development environment:

```bash
nix develop
```

To run all tests:

```bash
nix flake check
```

To build an individual derivation:
```bash
nix build -L .#<derivation>
```
For example:
```bash
nix build -L .#proof-producer
```

To list all available nix-targets, call
```bash
nix flake show
```
If the build fails with OOM, cores number to use could be set with `--cores` [option](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.25/command-ref/nix-build.html#opt-cores).

For incremental build:
```bash
nix develop .#<derivation>
eval "$configurePhase" // automatically move to the build directory
eval "$buildPhase" // build
eval "$checkPhase" // run tests
```

if you want to build a single target:
```bash
nix develop .#<derivation>
eval "$configurePhase" // automatically move to the build directory
ninja <target>
```
